## Programming Languages

### PHP

#### Magic Hashes

Common vulnerability in PHP that fakes hash "collisions" where the == operator falls short in PHP type comparison, thinking everything that follows 0e is considered scientific notation (and therefore 0).

### Magic numbers

The starting values that identify a file format. These are often crucial for programs to properly read a certain file type, so they must be correct. If some files are acting strangely, try verifying their magic number with a trusted list of file signatures.
