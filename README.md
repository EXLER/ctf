Shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability.

* Shellcodes database - [shell-storm.org](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/)
* Shellcode generation using `pwntools` - [Documentation](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/shellcraft.html)

### Random values

When the seed is not given for the rand method, the seed will always be starting on 1. Therefore rand will always give the same answer when the method in only called once in the program.

Not every OS/system has the same implementation of the rand function. Therefore you need to determine which random value will be generated on the server.

## Programming Languages

### PHP

#### Magic Hashes

Common vulnerability in PHP that fakes hash "collisions" where the == operator falls short in PHP type comparison, thinking everything that follows 0e is considered scientific notation (and therefore 0).

### Magic numbers

The starting values that identify a file format. These are often crucial for programs to properly read a certain file type, so they must be correct. If some files are acting strangely, try verifying their magic number with a trusted list of file signatures.

* Magic numbers on Wikipedia: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Magic_numbers_in_files)

## Cryptography

### Caesar Cipher

Classic shift cipher. Below is a bash one-liner using `caesar` (from package `bsdgames`) to try all shift positions.

```bash
$ cipher='jeoi{geiwev_gmtliv_ws_svmkmrep}' ; for i in {0..25}; do echo $cipher | caesar $i; done
```

### Vigen√®re Cipher

Vigen√®re cipher has several Caesar ciphers in sequence with different shift values. 

* Cipher explanation - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Description)
* Online cipher analysis & cracking - [f00l.de](http://f00l.de/hacking/vigenere.php)

### Frequency analysis

Frequency analysis is a technique used to break classical ciphers. Frequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies.

* Online frequency analysis - [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/frequency-analysis)

## Substitution cipher

Substitution cipher is a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution.
